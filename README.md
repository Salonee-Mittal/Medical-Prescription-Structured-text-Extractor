# ðŸ§  Medical Prescription Structured text Extractor using Gemini (Multimodal LLM)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to extract **structured information** from **handwritten medical prescriptions** using **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, a multimodal large language model (LLM) by Google.

We extract key medical details like patient name, doctor name, medications (including dosage, frequency, duration), and evaluate the accuracy using **Word Error Rate (WER)** and **Character Error Rate (CER)**.

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure
- data: prescription images + GroundTruth.csv
- output: extracted_text.csv, Evaluation_results.png
- scripts: Medical_Prescription(1).ipynb

## ðŸ§  Model: Google Gemini Flash 2.0

We use Gemini's vision capabilities to extract structured data from prescription images via prompts.

### Prompt Used and it's Structure:
-```You are an AI assistant that extracts structured data from a handwritten medical prescription. Please return the output in valid JSON format with the following schema:
{
  "date": str,
  "patient_name": str,
  "patient_age": str,
  "patient_gender": str,
  "patient_address": str,
  "doctor_name": str,
  "doctor_address": str,
  "doctor_specialty": str,
  "medicine_name": str,
  "medicine_dosage": str,
  "medicine_frequency": str,
  "medicine_duration": str,
  "diagnosis": str,
  "other_instructions": str
}

Notes:
- If any value is not found, return it as an empty string.
- Extract only the most important or first-mentioned medicine from the prescription.
- Use full forms for abbreviations if possible.

## Evaluation Strategy
We compare Geminiâ€™s text output with manually annotated ground truth text using:
âœ… Word Error Rate (WER): % of word-level errors
âœ… Character Error Rate (CER): % of character-level errors
Both are computed using the Hugging Face evaluate library.

## How to Run
- Upload your images into data.
- Add your Gemini API key into the script
- Run Medical_Prescriptions(1).ipynb

View output in extracted_text.csv and evaluation results in Evaluation_results.png
